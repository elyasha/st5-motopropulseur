# ST5 Motopropulseur (Group 1)

GitHub repository for our ST5 challenge week. This repository contains all Simulink and MATLAB files needed to see the simulations of our Hybrid Eletric Vehicles (HEV). 
The project was developed between 8 November 2019 and 15 November 2019. The project was presented at CentraleSupélec (15 November 2019).

## Getting Started
In order to see our files, just clone the repository in your local machine and you can run the simulations in Simulink. The parameters of the simulations are (usually) written and defined in .m scripts for each model.

## Prerequisites
In order to well run the files, you will need 
1. MATLAB R2019b
2. Driveline
